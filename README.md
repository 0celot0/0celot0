I apologise if I don't respond to messages sometimes!! I almost always have pony town on in the background while I am working on something else. I am most likely not off-tab tho! I keep my pony town tab on my other monitor so I probably will still see it.

I am ALWAYS open to C+H!!! 　𐂯　 I have never had a problem w/ this, but please do not copy off of my skins!! Idm slightly referencing (like a certain part, such as the way I shaded the hair or smt), js please do not screenshot and color pick at all. 　𐂯　Also, please do not cover me!! Even if u usually sit in the spot I'm at or spawned there, js go sit somewhere else 💔 I remember getting into an arguement w/ some1 like a year or 2 ago where they js sat in front of me and my friend bc "they 'always' sat there."
